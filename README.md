# Today's Deep Learning

We want to recommend the best Arvix papers in (cs.[CV|CL|LG|AI|NE]/stat.ML) categories.
We will pull the papers everyday and the users will upvote the papers they recommend.
The papers will be ranked based on the number of votes they received during the day, week, and month.

## See it in action
